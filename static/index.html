  <h1>Synthy 3</h1>

  <p>Synthy 3 is a collaborative note sender.</p>

  <small>(This is a very early version so will no doubt have bugs. It doesn't work on Safari yet. Please add bugs, ideas, pull request improvements to <a href="https://github.com/filipnest/synthy3">github.com/filipnest/synthy3</a>). Open source.</small>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>Synthy 3 has three parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A button for triggering notes to send to the world (hold down for longer notes)</li>
    <li>A dial for changing pitch<sup><a href="#pitch">*</a></sup></li>
    <li>A binary number channel picker for choosing which channel to send / listen to.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The channel picker takes a series of long or short presses to mean 0 or 1 in a binary sequence. For example: short press + long press is 2. The channel is the current channel you are both sending notes to, and receiving notes from. To change channel, press in a series of short and long presses and then wait a few seconds.</p>

  <small id="pitch"><sup>*</sup> - Pitch is based on the 0 - 127 MIDI note frequencies (MIDI out support is coming).</small>
