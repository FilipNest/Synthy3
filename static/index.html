  <h1>Synthy 3</h1>

  <p>Synthy 3 is a collaborative note sender. It has three parts</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A button for triggering notes (hold for longer)</li>
    <li>A dial for pitch<sup><a href="#pitch">*</a></sup></li>
    <li>A binary number channel picker.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The channel picker takes a series of long or short presses to mean 0 or 1 in a binary sequence. For example: short press + long press is 2. The channel is the current channel you are both sending notes to, and receiving notes from. To change channel, press in a value and then wait a few seconds.</p>

  <small id="pitch"><sup>*</sup> - Pitch is based on the 0 - 127 MIDI note frequencies.</small>
